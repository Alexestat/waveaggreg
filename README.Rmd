<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of waveaggreg is to estimate component curves from aggregated curves by applying wavelet shrinkage methods.

## Installation

You can install the released version of waveaggreg from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("waveaggreg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(waveaggreg)
# A = matrix(rnorm(80),16,5)
# y1 = runif(5)
# y = t(matrix(c(y1,1-y1),5,2))
# compfun(A,y,0.9,1,5)
```
